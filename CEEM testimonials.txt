
Brian, you are simply amazing! We would like to thank you very much for making our sales meeting ‘Every Second Counts’ , in Houston, an incredible event. By melding your magic illusions with the theme of time you really captured the essence of the meeting. Everyone is still talking about how you predicted the correct time on the giant broken clock.
